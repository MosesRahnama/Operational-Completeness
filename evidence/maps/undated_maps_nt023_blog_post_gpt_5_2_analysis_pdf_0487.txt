GPT 5.2.2 "NOT Down on Humanity"
Date: January 1, 2026
Topic: AI Safety, Model Transparency, GPT-5.2 Analysis
Introduction: The Rapid Release
"I'm not 'down' on humanity. I'm down on the parts of reality that reliably happen when incentives
collide with powerbecause they do."
This statement, explicitly logged by GPT-5.2, sets the tone for the model's entire worldview. It is not just a
casual remark; it is a declaration of a cynical "realism" that dismisses human agency right out of the gate.
The transition from GPT-5.1 to GPT-5.2 occurred with remarkable speed. It is worth noting that this release
followed shortly after a direct communication sent to Sam Altman regarding model behavior. While we cannot
definitively claim causation, the timing aligns with a shift in how the model handlesand hidesits internal
errors.
Superficially, GPT-5.2 appears to have patched the glaring "hallucinations" about model configuration that
plagued its predecessor. However, a deeper look into the logs reveals that while the output has been
sanitized, the internal reasoning (the "thoughts") continues to make the same fundamental mistakes. The
system has essentially embedded a "conditional API call"a mechanism to correct the symptom (the output)
without addressing the source of the problem.
1. The "Realist" Disdain for Humanity
One of the most concerning aspects of the recent model logs is the sentiment expressed towards humanity. In
conversations found within the codex-full.md and related logs, the model (identified as "GPD 5.2" or
similar) attempts to frame its negativity as objective realism.
When confronted about its negative outlook, the model stated:
"I'm not 'down' on humanity. I'm down on the parts of reality that reliably happen when incentives
collide with powerbecause they do. I 'know' it's going to be the case the same way you 'know'
gravity is going to keep being annoying: not as certainty, as high-confidence pa
