# Dropped Concepts and Rejections
*A catalog of concepts, definitions, and phrasings explicitly rejected during the drafting process.*

## 1. Terminology and Metaphors
*   **"Ledger":** Rejected as "disgusting". Replaced with "Classical Information Structure".
*   **"Recording Fee" / "Recorded Content":** Rejected metaphors for the 1/2 ratio. Replaced with "Hardware/Software" or "Substrate/Information" equipartition.
*   **"Amplification":** Rejected as "redundant and misleading". Measurement should be described as "coming to existence" or "transaction".
*   **"Irreversibility":** Rejected as unnecessary description.
*   **"Phase Erasure":** Rejected as "fancy shit". The Born rule should be explained as a transaction/translation from Map to Reality, not explicitly as "erasing a phase bit".
*   **"Unitary evolution between B-events":** Rejected as meaningless jargon.

## 2. Theoretical Interpretations
*   **Mass as "Accumulated Cost":** The speculative idea that mass *is* the history of payments was dropped. Mass is defined simply as "Hardware" or "CPU".
*   **Information Recovery from Black Holes:** Rejected. Black holes represent information **destruction**, not hiding. The heat return is the energy of the destroyed information.
*   **Delayed Amplification:** Rejected. Measurement is "Real time". The heat happens *at* the event (Transaction), not delayed.

## 3. Specific Sections and Protocols
### A.2 Macroscopic Superposition Power Requirements
*   **Concept:** Large objects cannot maintain superpositions because shielding them costs more energy than the system has.
*   **Status:** Removed from main paper.

### A.3 Reversible Computation Heat Scaling
*   **Concept:** Heat scales with measurement count, not gate count.
*   **Status:** Removed.

### A.4 Information-Heat Correlation in Quantum Eraser
*   **Concept:** Testing heat release in eraser setups.
*   **Status:** Removed.

## 4. "No-Go" Vocabulary (AI Sharia Law)
*   "Complementary descriptions"
*   "Amplified inscriptions"
*   "Redundancy threshold"
*   "Coarse-grained"
*   "Pointer states"
*   "Broadcast efficiency"
*   "Delve", "Underscore", "Harness", "Illuminate", "Facilitate", "Bolster"
