Extract:
  50: Added a minimal operator calculus OpTerm with primitives seed, wrap, and weave, giving you a universe built purely from operators (basic.lean:7).
  51: Defined the immediate-subterm ordering Subterm and proved its well-foundedness via the structural accessibility lemma subtermAcc, avoiding any numerical measures (basic.lean:19, basic.lean:28, basic.lean:48).
  52: Introduced core rewrite steps (wrap-unfold and projections on weave) and established that every step strictly decreases along Subterm, yielding the well-founded reduction relation step_wf (basic.lean:55, basic.lean:67).
  53: Captured the notion of normal forms inside the operator universe with Normal, illustrating how termination statements are phrased without external encodings (basic.lean:76).
