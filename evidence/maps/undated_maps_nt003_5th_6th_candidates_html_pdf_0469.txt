Opinion 1:
1 Adopt S1 (rec+eqW). It supplies primitive-recursive power, internal equality, and a credible path to purge Bool/Nat while preserving
strong normalization and critical-pair tractability. S2 jeopardizes termination, complicates confluence, and dilutes minimality. Focus
resources on lemmas L1L9, then revisit minimization needs; defer  until SN proof secured.
2 MINIMALITY IMPACT
rec+eqW: +2 constructors, +4 rules; +6 critical pairs; still PR-bounded.
 only: +1 constructor, +3 rules; +5 pairs; admits general recursion   heavier than rec in SN proof. rec+eqW preserves tighter
minimality.
3 TERMINATION & CONFLUENCE
rec rules: size decreases on -height; no -creation; critical peaks with ,ann,void solved by eager -reduction. Newman hinges
unchanged.
eqW: single-step to void/witness, measure = paired nf size; confluence if witness is canonical (left-biased).
: body may re-grow term, cannot supply monotone measure   SN doubtful; peaks with  unresolved.
4 EQUALITY-WITNESS DESIGN
Root-only version: eqW a b  (void | integrate ); recursive fold only on outermost nf; Sound: nf(a)=nf(b)   void; Complete: nf(a)nf(b)
  witness normal-forms unequal; Irreflexive fail avoided by canonical witness integrate(merge x y) with xy ordered by syntactic <.
5 INTERNAL RECURSION COVERAGE
rec gives primitive recursion on Nat-like -chains   addition, mult, bounded search definable. Minimization needs  or explicit -
bounded loop lemma.  exceeds PR; may code any general  giving SN risk.
6 GDEL PIPELINE
eqW allows plateau detection: define diag(F): n. eqW (F n) n. Remaining gaps: (i) code injectivity lemma, (ii) complement uniqueness, (iii)
