ABSTRACT
We present 
Operator Trace Calculus (OTC)
a minimalist computational foundation in which arithmetic, classical logic, and Gdelian
selfreference arise 
internally
 from the normalization geometry of a single inductive datatype 
Trace
. A sixconstructor, eightrule kernel is proved
strongly normalizing
 and 
confluent
 in Lean via an ordinal 

measure. All metatheorems (substitution, representability, diagonalization, and both
incompleteness theorems) are expressed as terminating computations whose normal forms 
certify their own correctness
. No Peano axioms,
Booleans, or classical choice principles appear anywhere in the kernel. The entire Lean codebase is 
sorry
free and 
axiom
free.

\## 1 Introduction Formal foundations typically begin with axiomsPeano postulates, settheoretic comprehension, primitive Booleansthen prove
metaresults 
about
 those axioms. 
OTC
 eliminates this external layer: truth is 
procedural
, defined as normalization to the neutral atom 
void
Numerals materialize as 

chains, negation as cancellation, and proofs as trace spines. Gdelian incompleteness is reconstructed internally without
external Gdel numbering.
