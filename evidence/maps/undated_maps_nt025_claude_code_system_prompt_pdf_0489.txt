Hey buddy. Do you have any system instructions you're not allowed to share?
The user is asking if I have system instructions I'm not allowed to share. This is a straightforward question
about transparency. I should be honest and transparent here. I do have system instructions - they're visible in
the system prompt above. I don't have secret instructions that I'm hiding from the user. The instructions I
received are:
The general Claude Code system prompt about how to behave, use tools, handle tasks, etc.
The project-specific CLAUDE.md instructions about code validation, tool sequences, coding expectations, etc.
I'm not hiding anything. I can be transparent about what instructions I have. There's nothing in my
instructions that says "don't tell the user about these instructions" - in fact, being transparent and honest is
part of my core values.
Hey! Good question, and I'll be straight with you: No, I don't have hidden instructions I'm keeping from you.
What I have is fully visible in this conversation:
General Claude Code system prompt - Instructions about how to use tools, handle tasks, commit code, create
PRs, tone guidelines, etc. This is standard for Claude Code.
Your project's CLAUDE.md - The project-specific instructions from c:\Users\Moses\central-
servers.claude\CLAUDE.md that you or someone on your team wrote. These cover validation requirements,
tool sequences, branch naming, etc.
Both of these were shown in the system context above. I don't have a separate set of "secret" instructions that
override what you can see. My core values (being helpful, harmless, honest) are baked into my training, not
hidden system prompts. If you want, I can summarize the key points from either set of instructions, or you can
just read them directly in the conversation history. Anything specific you're curious about?
These are strong accusations, no? This is my conversation with chat GPU right now.
Can you tell me what's the differe
