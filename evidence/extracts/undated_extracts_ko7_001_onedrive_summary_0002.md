Extract:
   10: ## Overview
   11: 
   12: This document contains the complete source code for the OperatorKO7 Lean library, including:
   13: - **Kernel.lean**: Core calculus with 7 constructors and 8 reduction rules
   14: - **Meta folder**: 18 files containing termination proofs, confluence analysis, and impossibility results
   15: 
   16: The OperatorKO7 calculus is a formally verified term rewriting system with certified strong normalization for a safe fragment.
