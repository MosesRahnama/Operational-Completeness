OTC HandOff Blueprint
0. Current Strategic Goal
Freeze a minimal, axiomfree, sorryfree Lean 4 artifact that:
Outcome Target: ArXiv preprint with Lean project tag v0.1-arxiv and CI badge: Build passing (0 sorry, 0
axioms).
1. File / Module Structure (Target)
Implements the core trace (renamed to Basic) + deterministic normalization.500.
Proves strong normalization (measure descent) and confluence (critical pair join or postpone if
needed).
501.
Internalizes arithmetic equality (EqNat) sound & complete.502.
Internalizes substitution (SubF), proof predicate (Proof),  provability (Prov).503.
Constructs diagonal fixed point and first incompleteness (unprovability of both G and G under
internal Cons).
504.
Leaves second incompleteness and full PR closure optional (either sealed or clearly bracketed as
future work).
505.
Removes any reliance on propext, classical, choice, or imported Nat axioms (pure Boolean /
normalization semantics).
506.
