VIABLE MINIMAL-KERNEL CANDIDATES (all assume  / ann / id / void rules already fixed)
 All options preserve cancellation negation provided complement-uniqueness lemma is proved.
IMMEDIATE HIGH-RISK PROOFS (uncertain even in O-6) P1 Complement-Uniqueness:  x y z, merge x z * void   merge y z * void   x
= y. Needed for sound negation, Boolean laws.
P2 Global Confluence with eqW + rec: Must enumerate and join every peak (, ann, rec, rec, eq rules). Failure breaks Truth predicate
(nf unique).
P3 Internal Derivability Conditions D1D3: Formalise substitution inside Trace, show Prov encodes modus-ponens and -reflection.
Mandatory for Gdel II. No prior literature in a terminating TRS; feasibility open.
(if any of these three collapse, Gdel II collapses with them.)
TIMELINE ESTIMATE Optimistic 23 weeks is plausible only if:  you automate critical-pair generation,  re-use existing Lean termination
packages,  and keep proof objects highly mechanical.
Otherwise typical completion times remain months.
NEXT ACTION Pick O-6, focus sequentially:
O-4 (4 OPERATORS) Core: void, delta, integrate, merge Extra rewrites: none How to get arithmetic: Church-style -chains, iteration
via self-applied integrate/merge gadgets (no dedicated recursor). Equality: encode by exhaustive -unrolling inside a merge loop.
Risks:  Strong-normalisation doubtful once self-application is allowed.  No clean internal equality   diagonal construction
becomes meta only. Status: adequate for Robinson-Q-level arithmetic; Gdel I achievable meta-theoretically, Gdel II unlikely
without extra operator.
1.
O-5A (5 OPERATORS: recursion) Core: void, delta, integrate, merge, rec New rules: Rrec rec b s void    b Rrec rec b s
(delta n)  s (rec b s n) Arithmetic & bounded search become primitive-recursive inside the system. Equality: still needs meta
traversal  diagonal inside still blocked. SN proof: by -height measure. Confluence: trivial
