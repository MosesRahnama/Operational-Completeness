and SelfReference via Trace Normalization

Abstract
We present a fully selfcontained, operatorcentric, axiomfree (externally) framework for arithmetic, logic,
and Gdelian selfreference in which  all traditional metaapparatus (axiom schemata, primitive numerals,
Booleans, equality axioms, Peano postulates, classical principles) are eliminated. A single inductive datatype
of traces together with a terminating, confluent normalization geometry produces: (i) emergent numerals
(deltachains), (ii) cancellationbased negation, (iii) deterministic evaluation of arithmetic, (iv) internal proof
objects with an executable correctness predicate, (v) a  provability predicate, (vi) an internally constructed
Gdel fixed point, (vii) incompleteness theorems derived as  geometric invariants of normalization rather
than syntactic metaarguments. Confluence, substitution correctness, representability of primitive recursive
fragments,  and  diagonalization  are  treated  as  normalization  artifacts.  This  procedural  reframing
reinterprets incompleteness as the stabilization of a selfdescriptive operator under trace coding rather
than the limit of axiom enumeration.
Executive Summary
Objective. Provide a  numeralfree, booleanfree, axiomfree computational substrate in which arithmetic,
logic,  proof,  and  Gdel  selfreference  are  emergent  phenomena of  a  single  deterministic  normalization
engine operating over a minimal trace language.
Core Construct. An inductive  Trace datatype with constructors:  void, delta, integrate, merge, 
var, lam, app, tag, pair. No primitive Nat/Bool/axioms. Semantics arise solely from  normalization
(rewrite geometry): contraction, annihilation (integrate/delta cancellation), idempotent & neutral merge
simplifications, structural propagation.
