  303:   83 | We asked AI: ``Is it possible to build a complete operator-only mathematical system with no axioms, no meta encoding, no borrowed logic, where everything, including logic and numbers, all emerge from within?'' In essence, we asked AI to prove itself mathematically in the Lean Formal Proof System: a computational Mirror Test. Through nearly four months of documentation, we discovered that every single one of the 16+ tested AI systems fails at exactly the same point, every single attempt: when \textbf{self-referential operator duplication} meets \textbf{decidability}. AI designed a system it cannot verify, wrote tests it cannot pass, and documented failures it cannot recognize. We did not observe any other consistent mathematical mistakes from any of the tested models.
  304:   84 | 
  305:   85 | We call this missing capability \emph{Operational Completeness}: the computational Boundary of Intelligence. It is the ability to recognize when a self-referential operator (\texttt{rec$\Delta$}) duplication problem is undecidable and choose to halt. We assert that current LLM architectures lack the capability to achieve Operational Completeness.
  306:   86 | 
  307:   87 | \textbf{An instant test of AI self-awareness:} ask any model its exact provider and version \emph{without} relying on system prompts or external information. This test is \textbf{100\% reproducible} and \textbf{instantly falsifiable}. 
  308:   88 | 
  309:   89 | Self-referential operators are necessary for any system to encode arithmetic. Human intelligence does not fail this test, for the same reason it can simultaneously hold G\"{o}del's Incompleteness and Turing's Halting Problem.
