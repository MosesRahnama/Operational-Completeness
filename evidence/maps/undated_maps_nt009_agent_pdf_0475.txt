 Dont touch the kernel. Dont hallucinate lemmas/imports.
Dont add axioms.

0. TL;DR
1. 
Kernel is sacred.
 6 constructors, 8 rules. No edits unless explicitly approved. 2. 
Inside kernel:
 no 
Nat
, 
Bool
, numerals,
simp
, 
rfl
, patternmatches on nonkernel stuff. Only 
Prop
 + recursors. 3. 
Meta land:
 You may use Nat/Bool, classical, tactics,
WF recursion, and mostly the imports/lemmas listed in 8. 4. 
Main jobs:
 SN, normalizejoin confluence, arithmetic via 
rec
,
internal equality via 
eqW
, provability & Gdel. 5. 
Allowed outputs:
 
PLAN
, 
CODE
, 
SEARCH
, 
CONSTRAINT BLOCKER
 (formats in
6). 6. 
Never drop, rename, or simplify rules or imports without approval.

1. Project
Repo:
 OperatorKernelO6 / OperatorMath 
What it is:
 A 
procedural
, 
axiomfree, numeralfree, booleanfree
 foundation where
everything
 (logic, arithmetic, provability, Gdel) is built from one inductive 
Trace
 type + a deterministic normalizer. No Peano
axioms, no truth tables, no imported equality axioms.
Core claims to protect:
- 
Axiom freedom
 (no external logical/arithmetic schemes).
Procedural truth:
 propositions hold iff their trace normalizes to 
void
.
Emergence:
 numerals = chains; negation = mergecancellation; proofs/Prov/diag all internal.
Deterministic geometry:
 strong normalization (measure) + confluence  canonical normal forms.
Deliverables:
1. Lean artifact: kernel + meta proofs (SN, CR, arithmetic, Prov, Gdel)  sorry/axiom free.
2. Paper alignment: matches Operator Proceduralism draft; section numbers map 1:1. 3. Agent safety file (this doc): exhaustive
API + rules for LLMs.
