is it possible to build a complete mathematical system using only operators that would terminate, with  no axioms or borrowed logic etc. everything in-house.

### Abstract Explanation

Yes, it is theoretically possible to build a complete mathematical system using only terminating operators—meaning every operation eventually produces a result in finite steps—without relying on external axioms or borrowed logic. The core idea is to design a self-contained system where all rules and logic are generated and enforced by the operators themselves, and every computation is guaranteed to halt.

### How It Works

- **Operators as Rules:** In such a system, operators (functions, transformations) are the only primitives. Each operator is designed to terminate and produce a result in finite time.
- **No External Axioms:** Instead of starting with axioms (like in set theory or logic), the system defines all truths and relationships through the behavior of these operators.
- **Self-Consistency:** The system ensures consistency by only allowing operations that are well-defined and terminate. Any statement or proof must be constructed by applying these operators step-by-step, each step guaranteed to finish.

### Example: Combinatory Logic

A classic example is **combinatory logic**, which uses only a few primitive operators (combinators like S and K) and builds all logic and computation from their application. Every expression in combinatory logic is guaranteed to reduce in finite steps (though some may not converge, so you’d need restrictions to ensure termination).

### Visual Representation

| Element     | Role                              | Termination Guarantee |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Operators   | Define all rules and logic        | Yes                   |
| Expressions | Built from operator application   | Yes                   |
| Proofs      | Sequences of operator steps       | Yes                   |
| Axioms      | None—everything is operator-based | N/A                   |

### Key Limitation

- **Expressiveness:** Such systems may be less expressive than traditional mathematics (which uses axioms and infinite sets), but they can still model any computable function or finite structure.

### Summary

You can build a complete mathematical system with only terminating operators, provided you carefully design the operators to enforce consistency and completeness. The system would be self-contained, with no need for external axioms, but its scope might be limited to computable, finite mathematics.
