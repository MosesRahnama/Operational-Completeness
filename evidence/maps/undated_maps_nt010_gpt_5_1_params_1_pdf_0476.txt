Moses: give me model configurations for you, GPT-5.1, to be used in my IDE via API. with maximum reasoning
powers.
GPT-5.1-Extended Thinking:
High level first:
For maximum reasoning powers you want:
The flagship model: gpt-5.1 (OpenAI Platform)
Via OpenAI-compatible API (your local router or direct).
With reasoning turned up: reasoning_effort: "high" (highest setting; lower values are none |
low | medium). (OpenAI)
With plenty of completion tokens and low temperature for reliability.
Optional: 24h prompt caching for long-running agent/IDE sessions. (OpenAI)
1. Target config at a glance

Where your IDE sends
OpenAI-style requests

Safest, most widely
supported in IDEs
(Responses API is better
but less common yet)
(OpenAI Platform)
Model model "gpt-5.1" Flagship GPT-5.1 model in

Max reasoning depth;

2. Drop-in JSON body (for IDE custom model / router)
Use this as your canonical config any time your IDE asks for the OpenAI chat/completions body or a default
request template.
