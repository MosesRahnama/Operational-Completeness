I need to configure Claude Opus 4.5 for maximum reasoning ability. Please provide the optimal settings for
temperature and top_k parameters to enhance logical reasoning and reduce randomness. Explain your
choices.

Short answer:
For Claude Opus 4.5, if your goal is max reasoning + minimum randomness, run it as close to greedy as the
API allows:
Parameter Value Effect on reasoning
temperature 0.0 Forces most likely token every step  maximal stability, reproducibility
top_k 1 Restricts choices to the single highest-probability token  no sampling tail
1. Why temperature = 0.0?
Temperature directly controls randomness: lower  more predictable, higher  more creative and noisy.

Empirical work on problem-solving tasks (math, logic, MCQA) finds that varying temperature between 0.0 and
1.0 does not significantly improve accuracy, but higher temperature clearly hurts reproducibility. The authors
concrete recommendation: Always set temperature to 0.0 for problem-solving tasks to maximize
reproducibility and avoid performance drop-off.

Given you care more about logical reasoning and reduced randomness than about creative variety, the
strictest, high-confidence choice is 0.0.
So:
Set temperature: 0.0 for any single-shot reasoning, tools/agents, math, coding, or planning with Opus 4.5.
2. Why top_k = 1?
In Anthropics Messages API, top_k means: only sample from the top K most likely tokens.

With top_k = 1, the model is effectively doing greedy decoding: it takes the single highest-probability token
each step. That pairs perfectly with temperature = 0.0 to eliminate randomness from the decoding algorithm.
If you raise top_k (e.g., 20, 50), the sampler still has a non-trivial choice set, which only matters when
temperature > 0. At temperature = 0.0, top_k > 1 is mostly pointless overhead: the top token will dominate
anyway, and youre signaling you might want
