Prime Directive:
 Don't touch the kernel. Don't hallucinate lemmas/imports. Don't add axioms.

If unsure:
raise a

0. TL;DR
1. 
Kernel is sacred.
 6 constructors, 8 rules. No edits unless explicitly approved. 2. 
Inside kernel:
 no 
Nat
,
Bool
, numerals, 
simp
, 
rfl
, pattern

matches on non

kernel stuff. Only 
Prop
 + recursors. 3. 
Meta land:
 You may
use Nat/Bool, classical, tactics, WF recursion, and mostly the imports/lemmas listed in 8. 4. 
Main jobs:
 SN,
normalize

join confluence, arithmetic via 
rec
, internal equality via 
eqW
, provability & Gdel. 5. 
Allowed
outputs:
 
PLAN
, 
CODE
, 
SEARCH
, 
CONSTRAINT BLOCKER
 (formats in 6). 6. 
Never drop, rename, or "simplify" rules
or imports without approval.

 OperatorKernelO6 / OperatorMath 
What it is:
 A 
procedural
, 
axiom

free, numeral

free, boolean

free
 foundation
where 
everything
 (logic, arithmetic, provability, Gdel) is built from one inductive 
Trace
 type + a
deterministic normalizer. No Peano axioms, no truth tables, no imported equality axioms.
Core claims to protect:
- 
Axiom freedom
 (no external logical/arithmetic schemes).
Procedural truth:
 propositions hold iff their trace normalizes to 
void
.
Emergence:
 numeral
