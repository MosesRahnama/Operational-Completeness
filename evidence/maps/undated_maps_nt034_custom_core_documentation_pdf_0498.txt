ABSTRACT
We present 
Operator Trace Calculus (OTC)
a minimalist computational foundation in which arithmetic, classical logic, and Gdelian self

reference arise

## 1 Introduction Formal foundations typically begin with axiomsPeano postulates, set

theoretic comprehension, primitive Booleansthen prove meta

results

## 2 The Core Trace Calculus ### 2.1 Syntax
lean inductive Trace | void | delta 
: Trace  Trace 
-- successor / layer | integrate : Trace  Trace 
-- cancellation scaffold | merge 
: Trace  Trace
 Trace 
-- multiset union / conjunction | rec

 
: Trace  Trace  Trace  Trace -- unary primitive recursion | eqW 
: Trace  Trace  Trace 
equality witness
### 2.2 Rewrite Rules (8)
R 
integrate (delta t) 
 void R 
merge void t 
 t R 
merge t void 
 t R 
merge t t 
 t 
-- idempotence R 
rec

 b s void 
 b R 
rec

 b s (delta n)
 merge s (rec b s n) R 
eqW a a 
 void R 
eqW a b 
(a  b) 
 integrate (merge a b)
Rules are deterministic; critical

pair analysis (Section 4) yields confluence.
### 2.3 Operational Semantics A deterministic 
normalizer
 reduces any trace to its unique normal form 
nf(t)
; truth is the predicate
