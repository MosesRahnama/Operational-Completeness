Evaluating the KO7 Operator-Only Kernel: Novelty, Robustness, and Appeal

# Overview of KO7 and Its Goals

KO7 is a minimal “operator-only” term rewriting system (TRS) designed as a foundational kernel for logic or computation. In KO7, the object language has only a handful of constructors and operators (no binders, no types, no external axioms); the rewrite rules are the semantics  . The current version of KO7 consists of 7 base symbols (constructors) and 8 rewrite rules, all unconditional (though some have guard conditions)   .

These rules handle operations like merging terms, recursive construction, equality checking (via	), and a

special “delta” operation for differences  . The guiding goals for KO7 are ambitious yet clear  : (i) Strong Normalization (SN) – no infinite rewrite sequences, guaranteeing termination; (ii) a certified normalizer – an algorithm that always produces a normal form for any input term (with a machine-checked proof of its total correctness); and (iii) under an additional local confluence assumption, unique normal forms, so that the normalizer’s output is essentially canonical. In essence, KO7 aims to be a sound and terminating rewrite engine with potential for use in automated proof search or computation within a theorem prover. Despite its simplicity, KO7 touches on deep concepts in rewriting theory and logic, including the interplay of termination with decidability of reachability (more on this later). The work under review includes a complete formalization in Lean 4, meaning all theorems are mechanically proved within a proof assistant, adding high confidence in the results  .

# Novel Contributions and Their Significance

The KO7 project introduces several noteworthy contributions. Here we break down the most important and novel aspects of this work, explaining their significance:

- Duplication-Robust Termination Proof: A core contribution is a rigorous proof that KO7 is strongly normalizing (terminating) even though some rules duplicate subterms	. Termination proofs for TRSs with duplicating rules are nontrivial, since a simple size measure can increase when a term is duplicated. The author devises a triple-lexicographic well-founded measure to prove that every

rewrite step strictly decreases a certain measure of the term	. This measure	has three

components ordered lexicographically: (1) a binary “phase” flag (to handle a change that occurs in

one particular recursive rule), (2) a multiset extension of a rank function	(using the Dershowitz–

Manna multiset ordering  ), and (3) an ordinal-valued component for tie-breaking on non- duplicating parts  . Using a multiset in the measure is crucial – it allows the measure to drop even when one rewrite step produces two copies of a subterm, by viewing the collection of subterms as a multiset whose overall “size” decreases  . This approach builds on known termination techniques in literature (Dershowitz-Manna multiset order and recursive path orderings   ) but tailors them in a novel combination for KO7’s specific rules. The result is a clean, formal proof of termination: for

every allowed rewrite step

, they prove

lexicographically	,

establishing that infinite sequences are impossible. This is a notable achievement because it’s done

without any unproven lemmas – the proof is fully machine-checked in Lean. It shows novelty in the

way different well-founded measures are composed to handle tricky duplicating behavior (something not every TRS termination proof manages elegantly). In fact, the author even proves a “no-go” result to justify why simpler measures fail: no fixed additive constant (nor even a simple

boolean flag) added to a depth counter	can orient the critical duplicating rule in KO7	. This

impossibility result formally demonstrates that a naive size-plus-constant measure would not decrease on that rule, motivating the need for the multiset component . This level of insight – proving a miniature impossibility theorem about termination orderings – adds to the work’s novelty. It’s not common to see a term rewriting paper include a proof that a certain kind of measure cannot work; here it reinforces that the chosen method (multiset order) is not only sufficient but necessary

.

- Certified Normalizer (Executable and Verified): Because the system is strongly normalizing, one can define a function that recursively rewrites any term until it can’t be rewritten further. The author

provides a function	(the “safe” fragment refers to using only the terminating

subset of rules) and proves that it is total (terminates on all inputs) and correct (the term it returns is a normal form reachable from the input)	. This is essentially constructing a verified evaluator for the KO7 language. The normalizer is defined by well-founded recursion (relying on the proven termination order) and comes with a machine-checked proof of correctness. The significance here is practical robustness: any term in the KO7 language can be reduced to a normal form in a finite number of steps, and the process is guaranteed not to go into an infinite loop  . Having a certified normalizer is valuable because it means KO7’s execution semantics are not just theoretical – they can be realized as an algorithm that is proved sound. This could be used, for example, as a decision procedure for certain problems encoded in KO7, or as a component in a larger automated reasoning tool. It also means KO7 could serve as a reliable execution kernel inside a proof assistant: one could safely evaluate KO7 expressions within Lean, knowing the evaluation will terminate and give a correct result. This aspect of the work emphasizes robustness and trustworthiness – the normalizer is not an external heuristic algorithm but a part of the formal theory.

- Confluence (Unique Normal Forms via Newman’s Lemma): Another key contribution is establishing that KO7 has the Church-Rosser property (confluence), at least for the safe terminating fragment. Confluence means that if a term can reduce to two different results via different sequences of rewrites, there is a way to continue rewriting those results to reach a common outcome. When a system is both terminating and confluent, every term has a unique normal form. The author approaches confluence by verifying local confluence (essentially checking all critical overlaps of rules) and then invoking Newman’s Lemma (a classic result in rewriting theory) which states that SN

+ local confluence implies global confluence	. In KO7’s case, local confluence was largely proved by an exhaustive analysis of critical pairs (each pair of rules that could apply at the same redex) – many trivial or easily joined overlaps were handled, and only one nontrivial case remained as a

noted challenge (a particular critical peak involving the	rule)	. Assuming that

outstanding case is resolved (or perhaps under a slight restriction called the “safe” relation that avoids it), KO7’s rewrite relation becomes confluent. The Lean development includes a “Newman_Safe” module that carries out a guarded version of Newman’s confluence proof on the safe fragment  . Achieving confluence (or at least a clear path to it) is significant because it gives uniqueness of normal forms  . This greatly enhances the system’s usefulness: if you use KO7 to compute or to represent logical proofs, you don’t want different reduction orders yielding different outcomes. With confluence, one can confidently say the normal form of a term is canonical. Moreover, confluence underpins a decision procedure: if you want to check if two terms represent the

same logical statement or same value, you can reduce both to normal forms and compare – a method only valid if the normal forms are unique  . The work here is novel in that it packages a “confluence engine” in Lean – the development has a module that, given the proved termination and a set of critical pair join lemmas, produces a theorem of global confluence  . This is akin to a certified Knuth-Bendix confluence check, but done manually in a theorem prover. It’s a robustness win: confluence proofs are notoriously tricky with many cases, so mechanizing it ensures no case is overlooked (indeed, the only divergence from full confluence is a clearly identified open sub-case, which can be tackled separately)	.

- Operational No-Go Result (Decidability vs. Completeness): One very interesting conceptual contribution is an “operational no-go” theorem that the author includes to clarify the limitations of a terminating logic system. In simple terms, if you encode a logical provability test as “reduce term to a special constant (like ⊤  for true)”, then in a strongly normalizing system that provability

predicate becomes decidable 21 . KO7 indeed has the property that if a term can reach	(a

distinguished constant) via rewrites, you can always find that out by normalizing the term – no infinite search is possible. While decidability sounds like a good thing, in logic it typically means the system cannot express very rich or complex theories (since those are usually undecidable). The author notes this explains “why single-level Gödel encodings cannot coexist with globally terminating proof search”  . In other words, if you try to encode an arbitrary mathematical statement as a single term whose reducibility corresponds to a proof, and you insist that your proof search (rewriting) always terminates, then you have made truth verification a decidable procedure – which by Gödel’s incompleteness means your system cannot be both consistent and complete for arithmetic. This is a profound insight connecting KO7’s design to fundamental logic limits. The “right move,” as the paper puts it, is to use stratification  . That means having multiple layers or stages of encoding so that while each layer terminates, you can represent ever more complex reasoning across layers (for example, a meta-layer controlling repeated calls to the object-layer normalizer). This contribution is more of a philosophical or design guideline, but it’s backed by KO7’s formal property: fixed-target reachability in a terminating TRS is decidable   . The paper even references known complexity results – e.g., reaching a particular constant in a terminating TRS can be NP- complete or worse depending on the system’s rules   – to situate KO7 in that landscape. The takeaway is that KO7, being terminating, will inevitably have a decision procedure for the queries it can express (normalize and check equality of normal forms  ). This no-go result is a novel way to articulate the trade-off between termination and logical completeness. It justifies the future direction of the project: adding a stratified meta-layer (essentially, a way to do controlled iteration or search on top of KO7) to go beyond the decidability barrier  . From a value standpoint, this analysis shows the author is aware of the system’s limitations and is positioning KO7 within a bigger picture of logic design.

- Lean Formalization and Verified Artifact: Finally, an extremely practical contribution is that all the above results are fully formalized in Lean 4, with a “green” (error-free) codebase containing no

The	Lean	development	spans	modules	for	termination

), the normalizer and its correctness proof (	),

Newman's Lemma application (	), and even an operational incompleteness

skeleton that captures the no-go example within the formalization	. The fact that it’s sorry- free on the import chain means every lemma and theorem stated is actually proved in Lean, giving a high degree of confidence in the correctness and robustness of the results  . This is a noteworthy accomplishment because formalizing termination proofs (with complex measures like

ordinals and multisets) and confluence arguments is quite challenging. The author leveraged and extended the Lean mathematical library – for instance, using the Dershowitz-Manna multiset ordering formalization from mathlib (in Lean) or similar constructs  . By doing so, they have created a certified library of rewriting theory results in Lean. This artifact can be valuable for others: for example, one could reuse the KO7 normalizer inside Lean to decide certain equalities, or study the formal proofs as a case study in proving termination and confluence. In summary, the Lean formalization greatly enhances the robustness of the work – it’s not just a paper-and-pencil proof, but something that has been checked by a computer down to the logical foundations. That reduces the chance of errors and also serves as a reference implementation. It’s also forward-looking: if KO7 is extended or used as a basis for a larger system, having the formal foundation means future modifications can be built with similar rigor.

In aggregate, these contributions demonstrate novelty on multiple fronts: a new carefully crafted rewrite system KO7 with proven properties, insightful theoretical limits identified, and a fully verified implementation. The work combines ideas from term rewriting systems, formal verification, and logic in a unique way. It is technically deep (e.g. the termination proof with ordinals) yet also conceptually provocative (highlighting the need for stratified proof search). The novelty is perhaps most evident in the integration of these pieces: while termination proofs or confluence proofs have been done before in various systems, KO7 offers a holistic package – a tiny rewrite kernel that is simultaneously terminating, partially confluent, executable, and formally verified. This combination is quite rare in the literature, making the work stand out.

# Robustness and Thoroughness of the Results

The question of robustness can be interpreted in two ways: (1) How complete and reliable are the results and proofs given (i.e. did the author address all important cases, and can we trust the claims)? and (2) How stable or generalizable are the results if we tweak the system? We address both aspects:

- Complete Formal Proofs: As noted, the author has provided complete formal proofs in Lean for all major claims (termination, normalizer correctness, confluence under assumptions, etc.) . This means there are no gaps in the reasoning – every critical intermediate lemma (like each rewrite rule causing a decrease in the measure, or each critical pair joining) is proven and machine-checked. The

development is “all green,” indicating it passes Lean’s checker with no remaining	(unproven)

statements   . This level of rigor is a strong indicator of robustness. In contrast, many theoretical papers might outline proofs informally and potentially overlook edge cases; here the formalization enforces that even corner cases (like tricky overlaps of rules or boundary conditions in induction) are handled. For example, the analysis of critical overlaps for local confluence listed numerous cases, each of which was addressed by a lemma (the project’s notes show a checklist of peaks P1, P2, etc., with all but one marked as solved	 ). This gives confidence that KO7’s properties hold as stated, with no hidden surprises. In the one remaining peak (a non-trivial overlap in the equality rule) that is marked as “open,” the author has isolated it clearly; the rest of the system’s confluence is established aside from that scenario	. Thus, even where the proof isn’t yet finished, the gap is acknowledged and confined – the overall approach to confluence is sound. It’s also worth noting that the formal proofs cover not just the existence of a measure for termination, but also directly yield an executable algorithm (the normalizer) which is proven correct  . This means the theory has been tested in a sense – one can run the normalizer on examples within Lean. The author explicitly states no claim is made about efficiency (the worst-case cost could be high, as expected for any

terminating system that might have very long reduction sequences)  . But functional correctness is assured. In summary, from a proof standpoint, the work is extremely robust: it’s been double- checked by an automated proof assistant, greatly reducing the risk of logical errors.

- Robustness to Extensions or Changes: Another angle is whether KO7’s design is fragile (tied to very specific tricks) or if it could accommodate extensions. The fact that the author named it KO7 and mentions a future “stratified meta-layer”	suggests an intention to extend the system (possibly KO7 is the object layer and a KO8 or a meta-KO7 would handle iteration or search). The termination proof uses a fairly modular combination of techniques (a bit, a multiset, an ordinal) that could potentially be adapted if new rules are added, as long as those rules follow a similar pattern (for instance, any new duplicating rule might still be handled by the multiset order technique). The confluence checking method via critical pairs is standard and would extend to new rules as well. One area of concern for robustness is guards/conditions: KO7 rules have some side conditions (e.g. “if ”) to restrict when they apply	. These guards were crucial in the design to

ensure termination (preventing certain infinite behaviors). The Lean formalization treats these guarded rules by incorporating the conditions into the definitions of the rewrite relation. If one were to change these conditions or add new ones, the proofs would need revisiting. However, the infrastructure developed (like the measure and critical pair analysis) provides a clear blueprint for doing so. In essence, KO7’s proof architecture is robust in that it uses standard, well-founded techniques (multiset ordering, well-founded induction, Newman’s lemma) that are known to scale to many TRSs  . It doesn’t rely on a lucky accident specific to one term.

- Testing and Examples: Although not a major part of the paper, the existence of a normalizer means one can test KO7 on concrete examples. For robustness, it’s good that the author can actually reduce example terms and see the results. The normal forms should be unique (assuming confluence) which can be manually checked for small cases. This kind of testing (even informally) can catch issues. Given everything passes in Lean, any test one runs in Lean will produce an output (since the normalizer is total). If there had been a lurking non-termination, the Lean system’s termination checker would have rejected the recursive function definition. The fact it accepted it and a proof of totality is given confirms termination is not just theoretical but effective. This runtime aspect (executability) adds a practical robustness: the definitions are constructive.

- Scope of Applicability: KO7 is a very small kernel, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, its very minimalism is why the authors could fully verify it and ensure all properties – that’s a plus for robustness (fewer moving parts, easier to reason about exhaustively). On the other hand, being so minimal means KO7 by itself does not express complex computations (yet). The paper suggests adding arithmetic encodings and exploring the system’s limits  . So a question is: will the proven properties hold when more expressive power is added? The future work hints at introducing more rules or perhaps a hierarchy of rules to encode arithmetic and beyond   . The expectation is that each layer will remain terminating, but one will have to carefully extend the measure (likely with higher ordinals for stronger theories). The current work provides a solid base case – a sort of “ground zero” that is well-understood and robust – upon which further layers can build. This strategy is sound: start with a tiny kernel that you know is correct, then gradually increase complexity, re- verifying as you go. So the approach to building the system is robust in a software engineering sense (each component is verified before moving on). There is even mention of mapping out the “boundary between internally definable measures and external ordinal strength”   , indicating the author is cognizant of how far the termination proof techniques can go internally before one needs

to assume something externally (like a large ordinal). This awareness means the work isn’t a dead end; it’s charting a path and acknowledging what will be hard or require new ideas.

In conclusion, the KO7 work scores very high on robustness. The combination of full formal verification  , exhaustive consideration of cases, and the explicit identification of limitations (like the one remaining confluence peak, and the general decidability trade-off) gives the reader confidence that the results are reliable. There’s no obvious logical gap or unresolved contradiction. The only partial result (local confluence has one case open) is clearly flagged	and does not undermine the rest (since one can either assume

that case or work in the safe fragment until it’s closed). The artifact’s integrity (no	) is a gold

standard for completeness in formalized math. Therefore, one can honestly say this work has been carried out with exceptional thoroughness.

# Comparison to Related Work and Novelty in Context

To fairly evaluate the value of KO7, we should situate it among related efforts in term rewriting, formal methods, and logic design:

- Minimal Rewrite Systems vs. Lambda Calculus: A comparison can be drawn between KO7 and the classic untyped lambda calculus or combinatory logic. Lambda calculus is also a compact, expressive kernel for computation, but it is not terminating (one can easily have non-terminating beta- reductions) and not confluent without restrictions. Typed lambda calculi (like System F, etc.) ensure termination but through strong typing disciplines that limit what can be expressed. KO7 takes a different approach: it forgoes higher-order functions and focuses on first-order term rewriting with carefully chosen symbols and rules. By doing so, it achieves termination by structural means and confluence by critical pair analysis, rather than by typing. In terms of novelty, KO7 is far simpler than a typical programming language or proof assistant core (no variable binding, no types, just rewriting), yet it manages to capture interesting behaviors (like a notion of equality, a recursive operation, merging, etc.). This makes KO7 a kind of laboratory for studying termination and confluence: it’s small enough to fully prove properties about, but rich enough to illustrate non-trivial phenomena (duplication, conditional rewriting, etc.). The value here is similar to why researchers study the pure lambda calculus or the SK combinator calculus – minimal systems often reveal deep truths. KO7 specifically reveals the interplay of termination with logic encoding (the Gödel encoding issue) in a way that a more complex system might obscure.

- Term Rewriting Literature: In the TRS community, proving a specific TRS terminating and confluent is common, but usually those TRSs arise from either competition problems or from encodings of other systems. KO7 can be seen as an invented TRS tailored to serve as a kernel. It doesn’t immediately come from a known algebraic theory or spec – it’s a novel concoction. The ideas used (like multiset orders, recursive path order elements, critical pair checks) are standard tools (as the related work section notes, they follow Baader-Nipkow’s textbook and other standard sources  ). So one might ask: is KO7 just a trivial application of known techniques or is there innovation? The innovation is in how those techniques are combined and certified. For example, termination under duplication is often proved using either the polynomial interpretations or recursive path orders. Here, the author used a hybrid measure that incorporates a multiset of ranks with a custom precedence plus an ordinal   . The inclusion of an explicit ordinal ε (perhaps $\omega$ or $

\omega^2$ in the measure) to handle “non-duplicating ties” is a clever trick to deal with any leftover decrease needed when simpler components don’t strictly drop  . It shows a deep understanding

of well-founded orders. Also, formally proving that measure works in Lean required encoding ordinals and reasoning about their arithmetic (with caution that ordinal addition is not strictly monotonic without conditions  ). This goes beyond what most termination proofs on paper do; it ensures even subtle issues like $\alpha + \beta = \beta$ when $\alpha$ is finite and $\beta$ is limit ordinal are handled  . So, in context, KO7’s termination proof is state-of-the-art formalization of what is usually an informal argument. Comparatively, libraries like CoLoR in Coq have formalized many termination techniques, but KO7 brings that power into Lean’s ecosystem and applies it to a concrete system. In the bigger picture, KO7 might be one of the first comprehensive rewrite-system formalisations in Lean 4 (Lean’s mathlib has basic multiset order tools  , but a full example of using them in a complex proof is valuable).

- Confluence and Critical Pair Analysis in Proof Assistants: Confluence proofs often rely on checking a finite number of critical peaks. This has been automated in tools like Maude or AGDA’s size-change termination checkers, but doing it in a general-purpose theorem prover is less common. The author manually identified and proved joinability for all critical overlaps of KO7’s rules (with the one noted exception)	. In literature, small systems that are non-trivial and confluent (like combinatory logic) sometimes have tricky confluence proofs; KO7’s case-by-case proof is a contribution reminiscent of those efforts. The mechanization of Newman’s lemma in Lean is also significant. While Newman’s lemma is a known theorem, applying it inside Lean required creating a guarded confluence module that likely proves that if every local divergence can be joined (local confluence) and the system is terminating, then a join exists for arbitrary divergences  . This is a nice reusable piece of theory for anyone working on rewriting in Lean. It’s a bit like re-implementing the critical pair analysis of Knuth-Bendix in a proof assistant. So KO7’s value is partly as a case study demonstrating that such formal confluence proofs are feasible.

- Provability and Automated Reasoning: The insight about decidability under termination connects KO7 to automated reasoning systems. Many logic programming languages (Prolog, Datalog) or automated theorem provers either sacrifice termination for completeness or vice versa. For example, Prolog can get stuck in infinite loops (not strongly normalizing), while Datalog restricts the language to ensure termination (and therefore is decidable). KO7 is more on the Datalog side of that spectrum: it ensures termination by design. The novelty is making this explicit in the setting of an encoding resembling Gödel’s trick of representing statements as terms. The author emphasizes that to get around the limits, you’d need stratification (which is akin to adding layers like meta- interpreters or using ordinals to well-order an infinitely progressing search). This is conceptually aligned with how, say, ordinal analysis in proof theory works – you climb a hierarchy of stronger and stronger but still terminating systems to cover more truths (Goodstein’s theorem being a famous example that requires transfinite induction up to ε₀)	. In context, what KO7 is doing is demonstrating a toy model of a logical kernel where one can exactly pinpoint the moment it becomes incomplete (because it terminates). This is valuable for the design of systems that aim to be both automated and sound: it tells you “if you want more power, you must go one level up.” It’s reminiscent of how in Peano Arithmetic you can only prove terminations up to a certain ordinal, and to go further you need to assume a stronger principle. KO7 could thus be compared to systems like ACL2 (which mandates termination of all definitional extensions). ACL2 ensures every function you add is terminating (often by requiring a measure), making the logic decidable in principle – ACL2 mitigates incompleteness by allowing you to jump to a new theory with each added axiom (somewhat like stratification, though not phrased as such). KO7’s stratified approach might similarly allow incremental addition of strength while maintaining termination at each step. This puts KO7 in

conversation with proof-theoretic ordinal analysis and independence results (indeed the paper references Goodstein, Kirby-Paris, Buchholz – key names in ordinal analysis   ). The work’s novelty is to connect a concrete rewrite system with these abstract ideas, showing a pathway from a rewriting engine to the ordinal tower of logical strength. Such a connection is not often made explicitly, so this increases the work’s intellectual merit.

- Other Formal Verification Efforts: Another context is the world of formalized mathematics and computer science. In Coq/Isabelle, there have been libraries like CoLoR (Coq Library of Rewriting) which formalize termination techniques and confluence properties for abstract rewrite systems. KO7’s Lean development likely drew inspiration from those (as indicated by references and similar theorem names)  . However, Lean 4 is a newer system and doesn’t yet have as large a repository in this domain, so porting or recreating these results in Lean is an accomplishment. For the Lean community, KO7 could serve as a foundation for reasoning about rewriting or for implementing certified rewriting-based algorithms. The value of a self-contained Lean development is that it can be integrated into Lean projects (for example, one could imagine using KO7’s normalizer inside a Lean tactic to simplify certain terms automatically, with a guarantee of termination). Compared to using an external tool, having an in-prover certified procedure is attractive. Thus, KO7 stands as a bridge between term rewriting research and practical proof assistant tooling. It’s a novel demonstration of how one can build a trusted computational kernel within a theorem prover environment.

In summary, when compared to related work, KO7’s contribution is not that it proves some long-standing open conjecture (termination and confluence of KO7 are new results but KO7 was new to begin with). Its value is more architectural and integrative: it brings together known principles in a new minimalist framework and pushes them through a full formal verification pipeline. It provides a fresh example that can educate or inspire both researchers (about the limits of decidable proof search) and practitioners (about how to structure a verified computation system). The novelty lies in the holistic approach and the clarity of the system’s design, rather than in an unknown phenomenon. This work honestly evaluates and demonstrates the trade-offs in logic system design (termination vs. completeness), which is a lesson that is highly relevant for fields like automated theorem proving and programming language theory.

# Potential Impact and Applications

Considering the potential value of KO7, we can foresee several areas where this work (and its future extensions) might be impactful:

- Foundation for Verified Proof Search/Automation: KO7 could act as a kernel for an automated reasoning system where every inference step is just term rewriting. Because each step is guaranteed to terminate, an automated procedure built on KO7 can systematically explore proofs without the risk of non-termination at the base level. For instance, one might encode a certain class of logical

formulas or constraints as KO7 terms such that a proof corresponds to a term reducing to	(or

some designated normal form). Then, using the certified normalizer, one can automatically check proofs by normalization. The benefit is that this proof checker is very small and trustworthy (much smaller than, say, a resolution-based prover or a SAT solver) since it’s essentially just the KO7 rewrite engine. This resonates with the concept of a kernel in proof assistants, where the core trusted code is minimal. Here KO7’s rewrite relation and normalizer could be that core. It could even be embedded in a system like Lean as a plugin or a tactic: given a conjecture expressible in KO7’s

format, Lean could reduce it to normal form and see if it becomes a trivially true statement. Because everything is proven correct, this would not compromise soundness.

- Decision Procedures and Complexity: With confluence and termination, KO7 provides a decision procedure for the theories it can express. At present, those theories are limited (KO7’s built-in operations look akin to a fragment of equational reasoning with some recursion on natural numbers). However, as the paper references, even small term rewriting systems can encode complex decision problems (the reachability problem can be PSPACE-hard or worse depending on the rules

). So KO7 could potentially encode NP or PSPACE complete problems and decide them by normalization. An example application could be a solver for ground term equations with certain forms: the  merge and  eqW rules suggest KO7 can determine if two terms have the same

“content” (since eqW a b reduces to

if

and

are equivalent in normal form	). This

is similar to a unification or matching algorithm. Perhaps KO7 could be extended to solve word problems in an equational theory (by orienting equations as rewrite rules). If arithmetic is encoded (as planned in future work   ), KO7 might decide certain arithmetic theories or at least reduce them to normal forms, functioning like a simplified rewriting-based SMT solver. The key distinction is that KO7’s decisions are obtained via a chain of formally certified rewrites, so the explanations (proofs) are themselves formally checkable step by step. This is attractive for applications requiring high assurance (e.g., verifying that a certain equation holds by literally showing the rewrite steps).

- Educational Value: Because KO7 is small but encompasses many fundamental concepts (termination orderings, confluence, critical pairs, etc.), it could be used pedagogically. The fact that all proofs are in Lean means that students or newcomers can load up the Lean files and interactively explore them. It serves as a concrete example of how to combine theory (like Newman’s lemma) with practice (like writing an actual normalizing function). It could inspire similar developments or be extended by others (for example, one could ask: what if we drop a certain rule or add a new one – will it remain terminating? A learner could try to adapt the Lean proofs accordingly). This way, KO7 could spur more library development in Lean around rewriting theory.

- Exploring the Boundary of Decidability: The mention of mapping the “boundary between internally definable measures and external ordinal strength”  suggests using KO7 to study proof- theoretic ordinals in a computational way. This could be of interest in mathematical logic: by gradually extending KO7 with new rules or meta-rules, one could reach higher ordinals (like adding a rule schema that corresponds to $\epsilon_0$-recursive well-orders, etc.). Each extension might still be terminating (if you well-order the extensions by a bigger ordinal, externally), but not provably so within the system itself once you reach the system’s limit. This is directly related to the concept of ordinal analysis, where one identifies the largest ordinals that a system can handle. KO7 provides a very concrete setting to perform such experiments: one can attempt to internalize a termination proof that uses a certain ordinal measure and see if it still goes through in Lean without external justification. If it fails, that indicates the ordinal was beyond the system’s strength. In this sense, KO7 (with stratified layers) could act as a toy model for Peano Arithmetic and beyond, shedding light on incompleteness phenomena in a term rewriting guise. Such research can have value in theoretical computer science and logic, as it gives another approach to understanding why certain truths (like the termination of the Goodstein sequence) cannot be proved in weaker systems. The project explicitly points to Goodstein’s result and Kirby–Paris (Hydra game) as inspirations   ,

meaning KO7 could eventually simulate those scenarios to pinpoint where additional principles (or ordinals) are needed.

- Integration with Other Tools: If KO7’s normalizer is efficient enough on small terms, it could be integrated with other proof assistant workflows. For example, one might use KO7 to simplify terms in a verification condition generator or to normalize terms in a compiler intermediate representation (where KO7 rules encode certain optimizations). Because the rules are simple and first-order, it might be feasible to extract the Lean normalizer to a programming language (Lean 4 can compile to C++) and use it as a standalone component. The guarantees of termination and correctness would carry over to the extracted code. This could interest people working on certified programming languages or compilers, as they often need provably terminating evaluators or decision procedures. KO7 might not directly compete with larger systems (like Coq’s rewriting tactics or Maude) for performance, but for safety-critical applications where you prefer a small trusted base, KO7’s approach is appealing. It’s somewhat analogous to using a simple rule-based engine instead of a complex SAT solver when you need higher assurance (even if it’s less performant).

- Community and Future Development: The potential value also depends on how the work is continued. The author mentions future work including completing the one open confluence case (to fully certify uniqueness of normal forms) and building a stratified meta-layer  . If those are done, KO7 would become a multi-layer system where each layer is a strongly normalizing rewrite system calling the next. That could achieve more expressive proof search without losing the guarantees at each layer. The community could then use this as a framework to encode various logics or calculi that are otherwise hard to handle. For example, one might encode first-order logic satisfiability at one layer and use a meta-layer to add a fair search strategy, still ensuring termination at each finite level of the search. The structured approach could yield a new kind of automated theorem prover architecture, one that is meta-circular and formally certified. While this is speculative, it shows the long-term potential value if the ideas in KO7 are fully realized.

In essence, the KO7 project has both immediate value (as a verified reference for rewriting techniques and a working normalizer with proofs) and long-term potential (as the seed of a more powerful verified reasoning system, or as a basis for exploring logic limits). The novelty of KO7’s design might attract interest from those who prefer simplicity and rigor over brute-force complexity in system design. By demonstrating that one can get a surprising amount of mileage out of just a few symbols and rules (with the right theoretical underpinnings), KO7 may encourage similar “small-core” designs in other domains.

# Suggestions to Enhance Appeal and Impact

While KO7’s technical content is solid, there are ways to make the work more appealing and accessible to a broader audience. Here are some suggestions:

- Clarify the Big Picture in the Introduction: Currently, the draft does dive into technical goals, but it might help to more vividly paint why KO7 matters in the introduction. For a reader with “zero math background” (as you mentioned about yourself), it would be helpful to include a motivating scenario or problem that KO7 is aiming to solve. For example, you could start with a brief narrative: “Can we design a tiny ‘brain’ of an AI that can perform logical reasoning but never goes into an endless loop? KO7 is our attempt to do exactly that – a miniature reasoning engine with guaranteed termination and unique outcomes.” Framing it in terms of an AI or a theorem prover kernel will catch attention

and give intuition before the heavy terms like “strong normalization” appear. Essentially, sell the idea of an ultra-reliable core for reasoning.

- Use an Example to Illustrate KO7’s Mechanism: Introducing a concrete example early on can greatly enhance understanding. Perhaps present a simple KO7 term and show how it rewrites to normal form step by step. For instance, you might show how an equality check works: take two small

terms  a and  b (maybe built from  succ and  0 ) and illustrate how	reduces via

merge and integrate rules to either void or some other term. By tracing a reduction sequence, readers get a feel for what the rules do and see the system in action. This also makes the concepts of “void” or “delta” less abstract. Graphically, if possible, draw a little rewrite diagram (though in a text paper, even a sequence of terms with arrows is fine). An example will also make the significance of confluence (unique normal form) concrete: you could show two different rewrite orders yielding the same final result.

- Emphasize Novel Insights with Reader-Friendly Language: When you discuss the “no-go” decidability result, consider rephrasing it in a catchy way. For example: “In a nutshell, if your proof system always halts, then it can only answer questions that are in principle decidable. This is a double- edged sword: it makes the system predictable, but it means truly complex mathematical truths (which are undecidable) cannot be captured at one level. We formalize this intuition by observing that in KO7, provability becomes a decidable property   .” Explaining Gödel encoding clash in simpler terms, as I just attempted, can help readers from outside logic see why that result matters. You might even relate it to a known concept like, “This is analogous to why certain termination-checking program analyzers can only work for a limited class of programs – if it always gives an answer, it’s not exploring an undecidable space.”

- Highlight the Lean Formalization as a Trust Factor: These days, many readers appreciate formal verification efforts, but some might gloss over it unless told why it’s important. Make sure to tout the fact that “all these claims are machine-checked in Lean, providing a level of rigor and reliability seldom seen in such theoretical work”. You can mention the artifact (perhaps even link to the repository in a footnote or so). This will appeal to readers in the formal methods community and also signal that the work is reproducible. In a sense, it’s a proof of concept not just on paper but in code. If you submit this work to a conference or share it, providing an accessible way to try out the normalizer (like a small appendix or a code snippet in the paper) could be very appealing. For example, show how one might normalize a term in Lean (the code invocation), emphasizing that Lean accepted the function due to the termination proof.

- Improve Accessibility of Technical Sections: The section on the termination measure with ordinals could be heavy for some. One idea is to move some of the highly technical details (like the specifics of ordinal arithmetic caveats) to an appendix or footnotes, and keep the main text focused on the intuition. You might describe the measure in words (as I did: phase bit, multiset of ranks, ordinal for tie-break) and then say, “the formal proof carefully handles details like ordinal addition not always being strictly increasing  , ensuring no subtle loopholes.” This assures knowledgeable readers that you handled it, without bogging down a newcomer in those details prematurely. Likewise, for the confluence proof, you can summarize the approach (critical pairs + Newman’s Lemma) and perhaps list the critical peaks in a table, marking which are trivial, which are nontrivial (solved), and which one remains. That shows the thoroughness in a digestible format.

- Cater to Multiple Audiences (Theoretical vs. Practical): It might be beneficial to slightly reorganize or label parts of the text for different interests:

- For instance, have a subsection titled “Theoretical Significance” where you discuss things like the ordinal strength and independence results connection. This attracts logicians and theoreticians.

- Another subsection “Practical Artifact and Usage” where you talk about the Lean implementation, how the normalizer can be used, maybe even benchmark or complexity considerations. This appeals to the implementers and those interested in using the work.

- Because you mentioned multiple fields of interest (and the possibility of multiple reports), it’s wise to make each contribution speak to a field: e.g., the SN proof speaks to term rewriting and proof theory, the normalizer to software engineering (program verification), the confluence to equational reasoning in theorem provers, and the no-go result to logic/philosophy of math. By structuring the presentation with clear headings, each type of reader can find what matters to them.

- Strengthen the Conclusion with Vision: In the conclusion (or perhaps in the intro), highlight the vision of where this is going. The draft does mention future work about a meta-layer and arithmetic encodings  . To make it more appealing, you could add a sentence or two about what achieving those would mean. For example: “We envision a layered system built on KO7 where each layer is a strongly normalizing calculus but the union of layers can address increasingly complex logical tasks – combining the reliability of termination with the open-ended nature of human mathematical reasoning.” This forward-looking statement can excite readers about the potential (even if it sounds a bit grandiose, it’s good to have a positive, ambitious tone). Essentially, answer the question: If KO7 and its extensions succeed, what could we do then that we can’t do now? Perhaps the answer is: build an AI that searches proofs without fear of divergence, or formally verify statements that were out of reach, etc. Even if KO7 itself won’t solve world hunger, showing its role in a bigger quest can capture interest.

- Typos, Terminology, and Notation: On a smaller note, ensure the paper is polished in terms of notation and explanations. For instance, ensure every symbol like $\Delta$, $\kappa$, $\mu$ (for measures) is clearly defined when first used. Since you want to appeal even to those not steeped in term rewriting, consider adding a brief “Background” section (which you do have) that explains terms like “TRS,” “normal form,” “critical pair” in layman-friendly terms  . You might already have that, but making it a bit pedagogical can’t hurt. Also, check for any typos or unclear sentences. A well-polished paper is inherently more appealing because it’s easier to read. Since KO7 introduces

custom terminology (“operator-only,” names of rules like	, etc.), perhaps include a

figure or table that summarizes the signature and rules (you do have a table listing rules  – that is great). Make sure the table is referenced and perhaps briefly discussed in the text so readers know how to use it.

- Visual Aids: If possible, think of one or two diagrams that could convey key ideas. For example, a flowchart of how the normalizer works (showing it as a loop that always terminates and yields a unique result), or a schematic of the stratified architecture (a stack of KO7 layers with increasing ordinal indices, perhaps). Visual elements can break up text and leave a lasting impression. Even something like a simple graph of the measure decrease could be illustrative (though that might be too detailed). If the conference or venue allows color or diagrams, this is a chance to make the work stand out visually. However, as the guidelines suggest, only include images if they add real value.

One idea: a small diagram of a critical pair: two rules applying to the same redex leading to two results that then converge. This could help explain confluence to the uninitiated.

- Engage the Reader with Questions: Sometimes, posing a rhetorical question in the text can engage readers. For example: “One might wonder: why not just use a simple size measure to prove termination? Here is where KO7’s duplicating rule poses a challenge – a naïve measure fails, and we prove it (Lemma X)  . This justifies our more sophisticated approach.” This style makes the text feel like it’s anticipating reader’s thoughts and answering them, making it a more interactive read.

- Targeted Outreach: Once the work is written appealingly, consider reaching out to multiple communities. For instance, a summary post on the Lean community forum highlighting the Lean aspect, a post on the Termination Competition forum or RTA list highlighting the rewriting aspect, etc. Tailor the message for each: e.g., for Lean folks, emphasize the library and how they can use KO7’s results; for rewriting folks, emphasize the new TRS and proof techniques; for logic folks, emphasize the decidability vs incompleteness angle. This will maximize the interest and feedback you get. While this is beyond the paper text itself, it’s part of making the work appealing to different fields.

In conclusion, KO7 is a rich and promising piece of work. To ensure its value is recognized, the key is to communicate its insights in a way that resonates with diverse audiences – from those interested in theorem proving technology to those curious about the theoretical limits of logic. By adding motivating examples, clarifying the real-world significance, and polishing the presentation, you can greatly increase the impact. The honest evaluation is that the work has strong novelty and robustness; now it’s about storytelling and positioning so that others see that too. Keep the core messages clear: KO7 is tiny but mighty; it never diverges, it always gives an answer, and it teaches us about the cost of always halting. Framed well, that is a very compelling story in computer science and logic. Good luck with the continued development and dissemination of KO7!
