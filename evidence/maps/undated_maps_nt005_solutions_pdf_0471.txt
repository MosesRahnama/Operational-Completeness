R (Primitive
Recursor)
R base step
n (unary

iterator)
High (PR
closure) Moderate
Adds

acc general
structural fold
Very High
(arbitrary
structural
recursion)
High
May look like
cheating
(meta
recursion
smuggled
in)
Wide:
substitution,
proof
enumeration
Mu
(WellFounded
Fixpoint)
mu F seed
reduces while
measure
drops
High (internal
diagonal &
derivability)
High
Harder
termination
proof
Diagonal, D1D3
EqW (Equality
Witness)
eqW a b 
void iff
nf(a)=nf(b)`
else canonical
nonvoid
Medium Low Focused,
simple
Removes
external Bool /
DecEq reliance
