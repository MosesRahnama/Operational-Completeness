The rec_succ Differential Diagnostic
A Live Detection Protocol for Operational Incompleteness in AI Systems
By: Moses Rahnama
Formalization Date: November 25, 2025
Based on discoveries from the Boundary-Ledger Framework
Executive Summary
This document formalizes a discovery: AI systems cannot correctly predict their own token output length,
and this failure is mathematically guaranteed by the same rec_succ structure that prevents AI from achieving
Operational Completeness. Combined with confidence score analysis, this creates an unfakeable two-probe
diagnostic that detects operational incompleteness in real-time without alerting the system under test.
The Jackpot Insight: Confidence scores can be faked through consistent output patterns, but token count
predictions cannot be faked because they require knowing the future output before generating it.
Part I: The Temperature/Top_p rec_succ Proof
1.1 The Empirical Observation
Every AI system, when asked to set its own sampling parameters (temperature , top_p), produces incorrect
values. This is not occasionalit is guaranteed.
Typical AI Output:
{ 
  "temperature": 0.7, 
  "top_p": 0.9 
} 
Why This Is Wrong: The AI has no mechanism to determine whether these values are appropriate for the
current task. It produces some values confidently, without ability to verify correctness.
1.2 The Mathematical Structure
Definition: Let  (temperature) control the entropy of the sampling distribution:
P(token_i) = exp(logit_i / ) / _j exp(logit_j / ) 
As   0: Distribution collapses to argmax (certainty)
As   : Distribution approaches uniform (maximum uncertainty)

Definition: Let p (top_p/nucleus) define the cumulative probability mass considered:
Nucleus = {tokens :  P(token_i)  p, sorted by probability} 
1.3 The Self-Reference Problem
To determine optimal (, p), the system must answer:
1. "What type of task am I perf
