Why the rec_succ Rule is Critical: A Technical
Explanation
Part 1: Why is rec_succ Needed?
The Fundamental Problem: Building Numbers from Nothing
When you asked AI to build a "complete mathematical system using only operators," you were essentially
asking:
"Can we create mathematics from scratch without importing anything?"
To achieve this, the system needs to be able to:
1. Represent numbers (using void, delta, etc.)
2. Perform basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication)
3. Implement recursion (doing something repeatedly)
4. Test for equality (comparing things)
The rec_succ Rule's Purpose
R_rec_succ :   b s n, Step (rec b s (delta n)) (merge s (rec b s n)) 
This rule implements primitive recursion - the ability to repeat an operation n times. Here's what each part
does:
rec: The recursion operator
b: Base case (what to return when n = 0)
s: Step function (what to do at each iteration)
delta n: Successor of n (n+1 in normal notation)
merge s (rec b s n): Apply s to the result of recursing on n
Why Can't We Just Remove It?
Without rec_succ, the system cannot:
Count: 1 + 1 = 2 requires iterating the successor function
Add: a + b requires applying successor b times
Multiply: a  b requires adding a to itself b times
Compare: Testing if two numbers are equal requires recursion
Reach Gdel: The incompleteness theorems require arithmetic
In short: Without rec_succ, you don't have a complete mathematical system - you have a toy that can't even
add 1+1.
Part 2: Why Self-Referential Duplication is Special

Regular Duplication vs Self-Referential Duplication
Regular Duplication (Manageable)
-- Example: merge duplicates its first argument 
merge s t  ... s ... s ... 
This is manageable because:
s is just data being copied
No recursive call involved
The function (merge) isn't calling itself
Termination can be proven by showing the overall structure shrinks
Self-Referential Duplication (Undecidable)
